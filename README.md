Predictive Maintenance Project
This project focuses on predictive maintenance using machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures before they occur, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing downtime.

Description
Predictive maintenance aims to forecast when machinery will require maintenance, based on data-driven techniques. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze equipment data, predict failures, and recommend maintenance actions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw equipment data for analysis.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict equipment failures.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using various metrics.
Prediction: Use the trained models to predict maintenance needs and failures.
Data
The data required for this project includes sensor readings, operational logs, and maintenance records of the equipment. Ensure that the data is properly formatted and placed in the data/ directory.
